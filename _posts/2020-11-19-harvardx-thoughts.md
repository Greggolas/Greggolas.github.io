description: How I'm staying busy while quarantining

This has been quite a year, and with all of the extra free time at home I knew that I was going to go crazy without some kind of goal to work towards (I'm weird like that). After looking at a bunch of online clases and certifications, I decided to work towards the [Computer Science for Web Programming](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-computer-science-for-web-programming) certification offered by HarvardX (an online-only provider of real Harvard courses).

There are two courses required for the certification. I have finished the first one, and right now I'm part way through the second one. The general structure of the courses is that there are a series of sections, each containing a lecture (~90 min) and a related project that incorporates what you learned. Then, at the end of the course you do a final project that is a bit more open ended than the other assignments. Each of the assignments is graded by either an automatic workflow or a manual review from the team at HarvardX. You receive a pass/fail grade on each assignment but can submit again and again until you pass.

The actual CS concepts covered in the courses are pretty entry level, but I've really been enjoying having the projects to work on, and I've picked up a few new skills here and there. I learned to write some C which is not something I've ever done before. That was honestly frustrating, but working with lower level concepts like pointers was a good exercise and something that I'm glad I did. I've also gotten more acquainted with the Flask and Django frameworks, and have been able to build some cool things with those. I'm starting to think those might be my go-to for working on little personal projects.

Overall, I'm really satisfied with the courses. The price was reasonable (It goes up and down but I think I spent a little over $200), and the lectures and assignments are pretty high quality. The instructors are great teachers, and it's really neat to feel like you are participating in a course at Harvard. Plus, getting a real professional certificate is a really nice outcome for the program. I'm aiming to have mine finished by the end of the year, and I'm looking forward to updating my LinkedIn.
