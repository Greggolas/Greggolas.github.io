It's been a very Bootstrappy week for me. I went through ['The Bootstrap 4 Bootcamp' course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/bootstrap-4-bootcamp/) this week for a refresher, and then got to work on replacing the out-of-the box Jekyll theme that I originally used for this site. 

I was surprised what a pain it was to get this Jekyll site setup for Bootstrap intregration. I could have just linked to the compiled Bootstrap CSS in the HTML, but I didn't want to settle for the default Bootstrap color palette, so having the SASS files was essential. I played around with a bunch of different options for adding Bootstrap with package managers, but none of these routes seemed to play well with GitHub Pages so I ultimately decided that copying the Bootstrap SASS into the respository from source was actually the cleanest way to go about it. 

I'm changing up the style for the whole site, and I think it's starting to look pretty good. I'm realizing the format I chose for the site structure might not make a ton of sense while I am fleshing it out with content, but I think I'm going to leave it the way it is since I'm still working out the overall direction for the site.

#### What's Next?

Eventually I want to play around with integrating some React components into the site, but I think I'm going to table that for the moment. 

This week, I'm going to focus on powering through the ['JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass' on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/). I don't have a lot of background in data structures since I didn't study Computer Science in school, and I think this will help me get semi-comfortable with some of those concepts. I'm hoping that some DIY Computer Science studying like this will be helpful in my next coding interview.
