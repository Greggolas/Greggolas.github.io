This week I'm taking a shot at publishing my blog update from [Prose.io](http://prose.io/#about). It's a cool little content authoring tool that integrates right into GitHub Pages. 

My goal this last week was to dig into a computer science video series that I purchased on Udemy. This happened a little bit, but not as much as I would have liked. I had to read some documentation for work that ended up taking up a lot of the time that I usually would have used to study new dev stuff, but that's enough excuses. I'll press on and keep plugging away at that this upcoming week. 

I did have an opporunity to listen to some interesting talks by developers at Amazon this week while participating in a convention. I picked up a few new tips for building applications on AWS, and it was really inspiring to hear perspectives from senior developers at the company.

I'm going to keep it brief and cut this off here this week *crosses fingers while submitting this first post from Prose.io*
