description: Where do I start...?
---
Holy cow! I haven't posted on here since November and that honestly feels like ages ago. So much has happened in just a few months, and the dev blog took a bit of a back seat to everything else in my life. In the time since my last post: I got married, bought a house, moved from Seattle to the Portland, OR area, and started an amazing new job.

Home life has been keeping me super busy these last few months, and that's amazing! But it does mean I've been spending a bit less time working on dev skills when I'm not a work. Fortunately, I work on a real dev team now! And that means I get to scratch my dev itch at work most days. I plan to keep this blog alive, and I will continue improving it and posting updates when I'm able to find time. 

It goes without saying that there are a lot of of crazy things going on in the world at the moment. I, like many others, am working remotely right now, and I plan to start setting aside some time for a few personal dev projects while I'm stuck here. I need to think about it, but I may do another game jam in the coming days/weeks to pass some of my new-found time at home. I'll have an update posted on here soon about whatever that project ends up being. In the meantime, be well, and PLEASE try keep your germs at home :)
