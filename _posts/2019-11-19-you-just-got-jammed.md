Well, I was worried at first that I wasn't going to be able to get this thing finished, but I did it! When I made my last post I committed to creating a submission for the [Game Off 2019](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2019) game jam, and I successfully submitted my game a couple of days ago. 

I was a little nervous going into the game jam because I wanted to actually finish a game (a thing I've never done), and I was picking up the game engine that I was working with as I went along. I was a little wishy washy about my engine choice going into the jam, but I ultimately decided on Godot and it was a great choice. There were a few hiccups at first while I learned about the various node types needed within my project, but I struggled through that for a while and eventually got pretty comfortable working in the engine. 

Once the jam theme ("leaps and bounds") was announced, I brain stormed for a while and came up with an idea that I thought would be simple enough to execute for my first project. Basically, a game with a character that is bounding down an infinite stream of platforms while dodging enemies. Kind of like a reverse Doodle Jump. Then I had to figure out art assets which was tricky because visual art is not an area of strength for me. Luckily, I had messed around in [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) a fair amount previously so I jumped in there and started doodling some very simple characters. A had a few up on the screen and my fiancee walked by and said they were "cute" so I just ran with using those. 

Coding the game was a breeze in Godot. The GDScript syntax is so similar to Python I was able to jump right in and start scripting things. I battled the physics system a bit, but after some trial and error and a couple of pretty full weekends, I made a game! It's nowhere near polished, but it's functional and some friends and family have already started playing and enjoyed it enough to trash talk about their high scores for a couple of days.

I'm very glad I participated in this game jam and actually saw it through. I'm a perfectionist and ordinarily wouldn't have put out something this rough. The timeline (and some holiday plans this month) forced me to work quickly and be scrappy with this project and the result was really positive. I don't know for sure what my next project is going to be next, but I think this was a good exercise in just "putting a thing out in the world." 

I may continue to flex out of my comfort zone and work on some visual art skills the rest of this month. I know I'm not going to blossom into a graphic artist over the next few weeks, but maybe I'll get a little more comfortable working in GIMP or something. I've also been considering getting back into a React project of some kind. We shall see...
