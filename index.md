Hey I'm Gregg, and this is my dev blog! I'm always tinkering with code or building something, and I use this blog to document the projects I'm working on. I also post regularly about dev skills I'm picking up and whatever else is on my mind.

Thanks for checking this out. Feel free to poke around on the site and reach out on LinkedIn if you are interested in getting connected.
