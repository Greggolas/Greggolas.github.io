# About

Hey I'm Gregg. I have dabbled with web development and coding projects here and there over the last few years, and I finally want to get serious about making some stuff and putting it out in the world. My hope is that by building out my portfolio and working on new skills, I will put myself in a position where I can eventually do development full time.

With that in mind, I'm going to be using this website to document my experience as I dive into the wild world of writing code and making things. I'll be regularly writing posts on here about the things I'm up to,and if for some reason you want to follow along with me on that journey, that's awesome!
