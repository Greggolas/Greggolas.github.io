# About

Hi I'm Gregg! For a while now I've been dabbling with web development, and I've decided it's about time to make that my job. 

I studied IT and networking in school and I've been in the IT industry for about six years, but I've never officially been a "developer" despite creating a handful of websites and tools for myself and my employers along the way. I find myself being constantly drawn back into this space, and I'm ready to do whatever it takes to land my first *real* developer gig.

With that in mind, I'm going to be using this website to document my experience as I transition into a developer role. I know there are a few things I need to brush up on so I'll be making posts on here about the things I'm learning, and I'll add links to some of the projects that I'm working on too.
